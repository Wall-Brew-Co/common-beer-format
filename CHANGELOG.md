## 2.3.0 - 2024-03-17

* Added
  * Documentation generation from specs to markdown.
* Changed
  * Specs now carry metadata indicating the BeerXML Types and Units they are associated with.
  * Specs may contain metadata to render human friendly names for abbreviated fields.
  * List specs are tightened to only allow valid BeerXML units and types.
  * Symbols have been added for all legal values for BeerXML List types. For example: `common-beer-format.miscs/boil`.
* Removed
  * Data (de)serialization dependencies (`clojure.data.xml`, `clojure.data.json`) leftover from `clj-xml`'s promotion to a standalone library have been removed.
  * Data generation dependencies (`clojure.test.check`) have been removed.

## 2.2.2 - 2024-03-10

  * Symbols for keywords in the fermentables namespace
  * Symbols for keywords in the hops namespace
  * Symbols for keywords in the mash namespace
  * Symbols for keywords in the miscs namespace
  * Symbols for keywords in the recipes namespace
  * Symbols for keywords in the styles namespace
  * Symbols for keywords in the waters namespace
  * Symbols for keywords in the yeasts namespace
